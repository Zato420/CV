    <strong>Boz the Lit</strong> is the Jarl of <em>Banjar Kuwum</em>,
    the last elected High
    King of Skyrim prior to the Stormcloak Rebellion.
    While Boz is the head of court at his
    palace in Solitude, the majority of his courtly duties are
    handled by her steward, Zoot Firebeard. Bolgeir Bearclaw serves
    as his Housecarl, while Bryling and Erikur serve as his Thanes.

  <h3><strong><em>Books and teaching.</em></strong></h3>
  <p>As the Jarl of Banjar Kuwum, Boz has both positive and negative
    aspects. The largely redonculous population of Banjar Kuwum supports
    both Boz and his rebellion, as Boz
    is considered loyal, and a good leader to his kinsmen.</p>

  <h4>Some strange thoughts:</h4>
  <p>
    1. We eat pizza from the inside.
  </p>
  <p>
    2. If you live to be 70 years old you will spend TEN YEARS
    of your life on Monday.
  </p>
  <p>
    3. Sometime in the future, someone will say your name for the last time.
  </p>
  <p>
    4. Outer space isn’t empty, it literally contains everything there is.
  </p>
  <p>
    5. When jogging, we put on special clothes so people don't think we
    are running from or to something.
